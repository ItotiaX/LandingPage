    <p class="dark">Hello! My name is Tristen, I prefer to go by Itotia lately. My plans for my career are to get into tech in any way I can! I would love to do just about anything in tech since all of it is fun! Creating websites looked to me like a great challenge so I chose to take this course to test myself!</p>
    <p class="light">I am also currently working on the Odin Project to help bolster my skills along with this course when I have any extra free time! I am currently working on making this page and it is leading me to believe I may enjoy web dev more than being a programmer.</p>
    <p class="dark">Creating a website that I can see work well in real time is a lot more interesting to me than making other interesting programs while still being in a field I enjoy! Hopefully I can make this my profession and I hope I do well in the rest of this course to get even better at it.</p>
    <p id="my-purple-paragraph">If I am unable to go far enough or get started in this profession. I still have the option to branch into other fields of just becoming a software developer. Maybe even get into data analytics and create automated systems for whoever needs it.
        To me, it is all very fun and interesting!
